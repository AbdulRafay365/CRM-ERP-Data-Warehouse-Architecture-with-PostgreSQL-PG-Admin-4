# Data Warehouse & Analytics with PostgreSQL

Welcome to my Data Warehouse and Analytics portfolio project! 
This repository showcases an end-to-end implementation of a modern analytics solution using PostgreSQL. It covers everything from raw data ingestion to polished insights through a layered architecture approach.

---

## Modern Data Stack Architecture

The project is designed using the **Medallion Architecture** model, featuring three distinct layers for scalable data transformation:

### ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Layer  
Stores raw, unprocessed data directly from CSV files. Data is loaded as-is into PostgreSQL for traceability.

### ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Layer  
In this layer, data undergoes essential transformations: cleaning, validation, and standardization to prep for analysis.

### ðŸ¥‡ Gold Layer  
This layer contains business-ready, analysis-optimized data. Data is modeled using a **Star Schema** to support robust analytics and reporting.

## Project Workflow & Goals

### Build the Data Warehouse  
**Goal**: Create a PostgreSQL data warehouse for consolidated sales analytics

- Import ERP & CRM data from CSV files
- Clean, normalize, and unify data into one cohesive model
- Focus on current data only (no historical tracking required)
- Model data using dimensions and facts for efficient querying

### Perform Data Analysis  
**Goal**: Deliver meaningful insights using SQL-based queries

Analyze business-critical metrics like:

- Customer behavior trends  
- Product-level performance  
- Sales growth and regional analysis
